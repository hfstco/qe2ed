### SERVER ###

    To run the server specify the port with the -p option.

    ./qe2ed -p <port>

    You can also use the common picoquic options like in picoquicdemo.
    (https://github.com/private-octopus/picoquic/blob/master/picoquic/config.c)

    ./qe2ed -q . -G cubic -p <port>

    The server can handle multiple connections at once. To shut the server down just CTRL-C the process.

### CLIENT ###

    To run the client append the hostname and port to the command. Of course, you can use the picoquic options here too.

    ./qe2ed -q . -G cubic <hostname> <port>

    To exit the client type "exit" into the terminal. Afterward, the qlog should be written to the specified directory.

### PICOQUIC ###

    To change the picoquic repository, modify the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory. Don't forget to clear your CMake
    cache and build picoquic again.
